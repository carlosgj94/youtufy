#Hola a todos!
**Youtufy** is a microproject to download and manage videos and playlist of youtube. And really easy to configure.
###The steps to configure it are:

1. Create next to the main.py a "db.json" file with "{}" inside, just it.
2. Config your Music paths inside the main.py. My paths are where i put cd or MÃºsica, its easy to find :)
3. Create a directory named "RandomSongs" inside this path. The program will put alone songs there.

The script is in python 3, it's really easy to understand, you can do whatever you want with it. And if you do anything interesting with it, just let me know :D
